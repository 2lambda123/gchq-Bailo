## **Bailo Marketplace**

The models added to Bailo are displayed in the Bailo Marketplace.

<Box sx={{ maxWidth: '75%', margin: 'auto' }}>
  <Image src={bailoMarketIcon} />
</Box>

This enables the models to be discoverable to other users. There's an exception to this, where the models are marked as
private. In these instances the model will not be displayed.

## **Finding models**

Models are discoverable by the search functionality or via filtering on the tags.

## **Adding a model to the Marketplace**

Selecting to **_'Add a new model'_** will enable you to create a model.

Adding this to the Marketplace is quick and easy and requires 3 fields to be completed.

The fields are:

- **_*The Model Name and the Model Description.*_**

These represent what is displayed for the model in the Marketplace.

- The 3rd field that requires completion is the **_*'Public'*_** or **_*'Private'*_** option.

The choice of these will determine whether model is displayed in the Marketplace.

The model is now added to the Marketplace.

## **Adding the Model Card detail**

Once the initial 3 fields have been completed and the model is added to the Marketplace, the user is provided with the
option to select which **_*'schema'*_** they wish to use.

- The selection of the schema defines the model card detail that will be required for the model.

- The model card provides a means of recording detail about the model, what it's intended for, what training and testing
  has been undertaken, what potential biases occur, etc.

- The model card detail can evolve as and when the information is known / available.

## Changing the Model Name or Description

To change model name or description, select the model and go to **_*'settings'*_** and amend the **_*Name*_** and / or
**_*Description*_**.
