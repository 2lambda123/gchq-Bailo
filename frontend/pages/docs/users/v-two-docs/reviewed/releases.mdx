## **What is a Release?**

A release is a different version of a model and there can be multiple released versions from the same model. Having a
release gives you the opportunity to make alterations, e.g. updates, adding new features etc, without affecting or
interfering with the original state of the model.

## **How are the Releases reviewed?**

Releases are reviewed by who the owner has chosen, to be the Model Technical Reviewer and the Model Senior Responsible
Officer (ref to completing the model)

## **Who can create one?**

Only the owner that uploaded the model can create a release. OR Only the user that uploaded the model/ owner of the
model and the users that have access to the model can create a release.

## **What does it mean to other users?**

Not sure what to put here

## **Approval process and roles**

When they MTR and MSRO review a release, one or both will leave a request for changes and/or approve. When approved by
both roles, this release will be moved to **_'Archived'_**
