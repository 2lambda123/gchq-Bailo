## **What's an access request?** (point to the section above)

An access request is to have approved access to a model that has been uploaded to Bailo.

## **How does the access request get reviewed / approved?**

This can only be reviewed and approved by the Model Senior Responsible officer.

## **What does it mean to other users?**

For other users this means that they have the opportunity of investigating and exploring other models/releases.

## **Approval process and roles**

When an access request is created, only the Model Senior Responsible Officer. They can either request for changes or
approve. Once approved this will be moved to 'Archived'

See [here](docs/python/notebook/access_requests_demo/#) on how to do this in Python.
