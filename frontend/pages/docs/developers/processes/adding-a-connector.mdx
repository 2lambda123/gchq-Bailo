# Adding a Connector

To find out more about Connectors and the standard connectors, see the documentation page in the 'Administration'
section. Connectors have been designed to enable developers to implement their own connector for a specific use-case.

Each connector type has a base class that defines the necessary methods for that type and the 'silly' implementations
are good examples of a simple implementation of all the required methods.

The recommended steps for implementing a new connector are:

1.  Create the new connector class.

- The class must extend the relevant base class.
- All abstract methods of the base class have been implemented.

2. Update relevant 'index.ts' file.

- Add the identifier that will be used in the connector configuration to the Enum.
- Add a new case to the switch statement that using the new Enum that creates an object using the new connector class.

3. Update the application configuration to set the relevant connector kind to the new value defined in the Enum in
   'index.ts'

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
