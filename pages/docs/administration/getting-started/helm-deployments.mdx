# Helm Deployments

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>

## Note

`Bailo/helm/bailo` lists HELM deployment configuration. In it's current form, the deployment is configured for OpenShift. Route configuraiton must be changed to ingress for k8s deployment.

## Prerequisite

Required binaries for OpenShift and HELM can be found at:
- [OpenShift CLI](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/latest/linux/oc.tar.gz)
- [HELM CLI](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)

## Deployment

OpenShift CLI and HELM CLI must be confiured on host OS to be able to deploy using HELM.
 
HELM templates are configured such that deployment behaviour can be changed by subsituting values in `Bailo/helm/bailo/values.yaml`, for example, existing MongoDB can be connected using \{\{ .Values.mongodb.host \}\} and setting `mongodb.enabled: false`.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gchq/Bailo.git
$ cd Bailo/helm/bailo
$ vim values.yaml #update with required key:value`
- create self-signed cert using certs/san.cnf and place them at; certs/key.pem and certs/cert.pem. Note that this is not for ingress or route configured URL.
$ helm dependency update
$ helm install bailo .
```

After successful deployment you should be able to browse to your configured route/ingress URL.
