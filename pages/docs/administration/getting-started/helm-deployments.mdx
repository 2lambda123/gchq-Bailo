## Prerequisite

- [HELM CLI](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)

## Deployment

- Configure OpenShift CLI and HELM CLI
- MinIO and MongoDB is enabled by default. See values.yaml.
- Existing MongoDB can be connected using \{\{ .Values.mongodb.host \}\}

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gchq/Bailo.git
$ cd Bailo/helm/bailo
$ vim values.yaml //update with required key:value
- create self-signed cert using certs/san.cnf and place them at; certs/key.pem and certs/cert.pem //This is not for ingress route connecting to your defined URL
$ helm dependency update
$ helm install bailo .
```

After successful deployment you should be able to browse to your configured route/ingress URL.
