- MinIO and MongoDB is enabled by default. See values.yaml.
- Existing MongoDB can be configured using \{\{ .Values.mongodb.host \}\}

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gchq/Bailo.git
$ cd Bailo/helm/bailo
$ vim local.yaml //update local.yaml with your overriding key:value
- create self-signed cert using certs/san.cnf and place them at; certs/key.pem and certs/cert.pem //This is not for ingress route connecting to your defined URL
$ helm dependency update
$ helm install --values ./local.yaml bailo .
```

After successful deployment you should be able to browse to your configured route/ingress URL.
