# App Configuration

## Configuration Files

Bailo configuration can be found in the `config` directory and file load order is as per the
[node-config](https://github.com/node-config/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files) docs.

App configuration can also be changed during runtime. For example, production.js can be overwritten during HELM
deployment `helm/bailo/templates/bailo/bailo.configmap.yaml`

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
