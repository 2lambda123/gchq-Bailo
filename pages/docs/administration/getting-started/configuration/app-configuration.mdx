# App Configuration

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>


# Configuration Files
Bailo configuration can be found at `Bailo/config` and file load order is as per [node-config](https://github.com/node-config/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files)

App configuration can also be changed during runtime. For example, production.js can be overwritten during HELM deployment `helm/bailo/templates/bailo/bailo.configmap.yaml`
