- MongoDB version tag ~10.31.3 https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
- Registry version tag 2
- seldon/seldon-core-s2i-python37:1.10.0
- maildev/maildev:20.0.2
- nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged

## NPM

Internal hosted npm repository is required.

## Optional dependencies

Selenium-webdriver and Sharp can be removed for isolated network deployment.

```
npm remove selenium-webdriver sharp
```

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
