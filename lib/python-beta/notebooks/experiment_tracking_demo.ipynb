    "In addition to core concepts covered in previous notebooks, Bailo also offers integrations that might be useful within the wider machine learning lifecycle. This example notebook will run through **experiment tracking** in particular. The following concepts will be covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating a new experiment using a Bailo model.\n",
    "* Conducting experiment runs and logging parameters/metrics.\n",
    "* Importing existing experiments from dedicated experiment tracking tools such as MLFlow Tracking or Hyperopt.\n",
    "* Publishing results to the Bailo service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "* Completion of the basic notebooks, in particular **models_and_releases_demo.ipynb**.\n",
    "* Python 3.8.1 or higher (including a notebook environment for this demo).\n",
    "* A local or remote Bailo service (see https://github.com/gchq/Bailo).\n",
    "* *Optional*: Dependencies for certain tools (e.g. MLFlow).\n",
    "* *Optional*: A local or remote MLFlow server, if following the MLFlow steps.\n"
